This section describes the steps required to upgrade Enonic XP from 6.15 to 7.0

== Requirements

Before starting the upgrade process, ensure the following requirements are in place

XP Version:: You need to be running at least Enonic XP 6.15.x (if you are running an older version, upgrade to 6.15.x first)
QA environment:: Ensure you have a QA environment where you can perform a test upgrade first (highly recommended)
Toolbox:: Ensure you have 6.15 Toolbox available
Enonic CLI:: Make sure you have Enonic CLI installed
Disk space:: Verify you have enough disk space to facilitate a complete dump of all existing data
3rd. party apps:: Verify that all (if any) 3rd party applications in use are upgraded to support XP 7.
Custom apps:: Make sure all custom built applications have been upgraded to support XP 7, as described in <<upgrade-apps#,Upgrading Applications>>

This guide focuses on completing an upgrade with zero downtime, and requires you to setup a parallel production environment
Carefully follow the below steps to upgrade your instance:

NOTE: For scenarios where downtime cannot be avoided, additional steps, such as setting up a temporary "we are upgrading page" will be required:


== 1. Create new environment

We recommend setting up a new production environment for XP 7, running in parallel with your XP 6 environment.
This will virtually eliminate downtime, and also be a safety net, should the upgrade fail somehow.

Install XP 7:: Follow the XP installation instructions matching your environment

File deployments:: If you have one or more applications deployed as files, replace them with their respective upraded versions

Update configuration:: Migrate your your existing configuration files from 6.15, and perform the following changes:

* app configs
* vhosts
* ports?
* system config?

Start servers:: Start your new servers and verify everything is working properly


== 2. Dump data

We are now ready to dump data from our existing 6.15 instance.

Readonly mode:: Turn on readonly mode in your 6.15 instance. TODO: ``toolbox bla bla``
This will prevent new data from being written to XP during the upgrade, and also ensure a consistent dump.

Dump data:: Use 6.15 toolbox to dump the data. TODO ``toolbox bla bla -noversions``.

NOTE:: We highly recommend dumping data without versions. This will dramatically speed up the upgrade while also preparing your dataset for the new vacuuming features in XP 7.


== 3. Load data

Move dump:: If needed, transfer dump files from previous step to the new server. For clustered environments, any server will do.

Load dump:: Use Enonic CLI to load the dump on your XP 7 environment i.e. ``enonic dump load -n <dump-name>``.
The load command will automatically upgrade data from 6.15 format during the load.


== 4. Install Content studio

Content Studio is no longer part of the XP core distribution.
Content Studio is now available as an app on https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market].

== 5. Update apps

Next all your applications must be upgraded to latest version to support XP 7

Market apps:: For market apps, go to your applications panel, and click upgrade on all applications where available. TODO Verify

Custom apps:: Upgrade all your custom developed applications by installing them, either through UI or the API.


== 6. Validate

Validate that your new installation is working as expected. We recommend checking logs, and performing live tests on services.


== 7. Go live

With all lights green, simply redirect all traffic from your old XP 6 servers (or upgrade page), to the upgraded XP 7 environment.
