= Deployment strategies

Depending on your requirements for scalability, performance and isolation, there are a number of different deployment strategies to consider.

== Single node

The minimal deployment of Enonic XP is limited to a single XP node.
Similar to the XP SDK, this node will act as both front-end and back-end, running applications as well as handling storage.

In this case, you will simply need a local file system to store your indexes, blobs (raw data) and backups.

== Basic cluster

The basic cluster will provide redundancy and scalability.
This scenario requires a minimum of three nodes.
As Enonic XP uses a distributed storage model without a dedicated master, the nodes will elect new masters based on a so-called quorum.
For this reason, there must be at least 3 nodes. With only two nodes, the cluster will not be able to form a quorum if one node falls out.

An XP cluster also has additional infrastructure requirements when compared to a single node:

* A *shared or distributed file system* for storing blobs and for snapshotting/backup purposes
* A *load balancer* is required to distribute incoming traffic to the various nodes in the cluster.

This strategy has a weakness related to stability, as it mixes the role of master nodes with working nodes.
Imagine that the current master node is hit with heavy traffic, or gets problems for other reasons.
In this scenario there will be problems communicating between the master nodes, and eventually the cluster might become unstable.

NOTE: This approach is not recommended for production deployments, check out the <<Dedicated master nodes>> strategy instead.


== Dedicated master nodes

In this strategy, a set of exactly three dedicated master nodes should be started, in addition to your working nodes.
The master nodes will not be acting as back-end (storing data) or front-end (handling traffic).
This way, you are guaranteed to always have stable set of nodes that monitor your cluster and controls where and how data is distributed.
As a direct result, you now only need two working nodes, instead of three.
Technically, you could even just start one node, but that would not be a real cluster would it?

NOTE: Due to the limited stress on these nodes, they can normally be of smaller size than the active ones.


== Autoscaling cluster

If you want to quickly scale the number of instances running an application up/down based on sudden changes in traffic/load, you shold consider this option.
This scenario builds on the dedicated master nodes strategy, but now differentiates between front-end and back-end nodes.

The front-end nodes will act as runtime for the apps/site/admin and handle the incoming traffic.
The back-end nodes will handle state, indexing and persistence of data.

The back-end nodes will typically be able to serve multiple front-end nodes, as the request processing if often heavier on the front-end nodes.
Scaling front-end nodes is faster and easier than nodes with data.
As such, this is an ideal model for autoscaling as well.

NOTE: You may consider if you need different type of CPU/Memory assigned to the different node types.
Typically, front-end nodes will use less memory than back-end nodes.

== Micro service cluster

For the most demanding projects, the micro service cluster strategy is the way to go.
It builds on the autoscaling cluster approach, but aims to isolate the various services better.
For instance, you might have dedicated nodes for the admin console, a specific site or app - all depending on needs.

The benefits of this strategy is a higher degree of control over each service and how it will scale, similar to how cloud native micro service platforms work.
I.e. editors working in Content Studio will not affect the performance of a site.

NOTE: In this scenario, each individual front-end service may be configured with different CPU/Memory and scaling options as required.
