Send and listen to local or cluster wide events

[#events]
== Introduction

The XP framework enable developers to create and/or listen to events.
Events may be local (within a single server) or cluster wide (distributed to all servers within a cluster).
In addition to application specific events, XP itself produces a range of standard events.

== Use cases

The use cases for events are limitless, but the most common are:

* Cache invalidation
* Notifications (i.e. notify clients connected to any server in the cluster via Websocket)
* Job triggering

== Implementation

For implementation details, please visit the <<../api/lib-event#,event library>> documentation.
