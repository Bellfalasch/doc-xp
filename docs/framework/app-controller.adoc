The application controller enables you to handle application lifecycle events

== main.js
Only one controller is commonly used across all XP apps.
This is known as the app controller, or just "main.js".

To add an app controller to your project, simply create the following file in your project: `src/main/resources/main.js`

The app controller is invoked for application lifecycle events like start or stop occurs.
A common use of this controller is initialization and registration of event listeners.

Simple example:

[source,javascript]
----
include::code/main-1.js[]
----

Running code on stop:

[source,javascript]
----
include::code/main-2.js[]
----
