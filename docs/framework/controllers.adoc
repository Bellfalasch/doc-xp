= Controllers

JavaScript controllers represent the core concept of the Enonic XP framework.

== Basic

Every javascript file is considered a controller, and the controllers are initiated through their exports.
The controllers are typically invoked by the various <<../runtime#,runtime engines>>, or by other controllers through the require system.

== Application controller

Only one controller is commonly used across all XP apps.
This is known as the app controller, or just "main.js".

To add an app controller to your project, simply create the following file in your project: `src/main/resources/main.js`

The app controller is invoked for application lifecycle events like start or stop occurs.
A common use of this controller is initialization and registration of event listeners.

Simple example:

[source,javascript]
----
include::code/main-1.js[]
----

Running code on stop:

[source,javascript]
----
include::code/main-2.js[]
----
