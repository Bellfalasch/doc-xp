== Site endpoint

By default, XP instances uses the port 8080 to serve web requests (aka the "xp port")
Within this port, the `webapp/`` is reserved for handling web applications.

By adding the application name to this url, you can access the webapp of an application, if available:

I.e. `localhost:8080/webapp/<app-name>/``
