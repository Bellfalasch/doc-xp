Developers can easily build webapps with the XP Javascript framework.

== Controller
To get started, simply add the file ``/src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.js`` to your project.

When deployed, the controller will instantly be serving requests on ``<server>:<port>/webapp/[app-name]`` (e.g. "localhost:8080/webapp/com.enonic.app.superhero").

``webapp.js`` now acts as a <<javascript#,Http controller>> and may expose a function for each HTTP method that should be handled: i.e.
GET, POST, etc.

The function that handles the request receives the request object as a parameter and returns the response object .

Below is an example webapp controller.
