== What is Enonic XP?

Enonic XP is a fullstack JavaScript application platform and CMS in one

We like to call it a "Web Operating System".
Portable PaaS (Platform As A Service) may also be a fitting description.

Inspired by the principles of traditional Operating Systems,
Enonic XP offers the essential services and tools required to build and maintain highly scalable web apps and sites.

Build your own <<apps#,applications>>, or use existing from the https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market place].

Applications are primarily written in JavaScript, but can also include Java, since the platform runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine.

=== Platform components
These are the essential platform components and tools:

* Javascript/Java <<overview/runtime#,application runtime>>.
* <<reference/storage#,NoSQL Storage and search engine>>
* Identity and Access Management - <<reference/iam#,IAM>>
* Extensible <<reference/admin#, Admin Console>> for back-office users
* Hybrid <<reference/cms#,Content Management System>>  when needed
* Remote management API
* Standard metrics API for monitoring
* CLI and software development kits for efficient .

== Why should you care?

The goals of Enonic XP are to:

* simplify development and maintenance of complex web apps and sites
* provide freedom proprietary clouds, and the ability to deploy anywhere
* bring a smile on your face


=== Fast

Enonic XP is seriously fast.

* Installing XP, building and deploying your first application takes less than 5 minutes.
* Enonic XP has a lightning fast embedded storage, built on top of Elasticsearch.
* XP is easy to learn, as new developers are typically trained and productive in less than a day
* Enonic offers application starter kits, so you get a flying start every time

=== Micro service style

The Enonic XP runtime, and the platform services can be seen as a framework for your app.
This means that application built on Enonic XP are essentially micro services.

You can use XP for a single application, run multiple dedicated applications in a cluster,
or even run multiple apps within a single runtime - for better resource utilization or modularization.

=== Stack in a box

Enonic XP offers a unique and tightly integrated application stack.
The runtime, storage/search, IAM (Identity and Access Management) and CMS are all released and versioned together.

This simplifies everything from the SDK, to building, testing and deploying applications, not to mention scaling.

You may also integrate XP and your apps with other platforms or infrastructure services as needed.

=== Javascript on the JVM

The <<reference/runtime/framework#,XP Javascript framework>> is based on the CommonJS specification.
But unlike most server Javascript platforms, Enonic XP runs on the JVM.

This brings benefits like:

* Multithreading (with ability to utilize multi-core processing)
* Access to and ability to execute Java in addition to Javascript
* Performance gains from the highly optimized JVM

If needed, XP can easily be configured to execute and interact with NodeJS containers,
especially in containerized environments.

=== Embedded CMS

Unlike any other application stack, Enonic XP includes a powerful CMS and API that can optionally be used for your projects.
Wether you are looking for a traditional, headless or hybrid (combination) CMS, XP got you covered.

The CMS builds directly on the other platform components. It enables you to create multiple sites in one instance,
and add multiple applications to a single site.

The editorial interface can be installed as an app, and we are confident it will bring a smile on your editors face as well.

=== Freedom

Last, but not least, Enonic XP is fully open sourced, licensed under GPL 3 with a linking exception.
This means that applications and tools built on XP are not affected by GPL, and can be licensed however you like.

NOTE: *Apache license* Almost all apps, libraries and other utilities on https://market.enonic.com[Enonic Market] are licensed with the permissive Apache license.

As open source software, Enonic XP also leaves you free to run the software wherever you like, on premises or in the cloud.

it is nice to know that Enonic offers professional cloud services and software support.
