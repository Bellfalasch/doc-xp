= System properties
:toc: right
:imagesdir: images

Every node holds a set of standard properties.
These properties are meta-data, with specific system defined purposes.

System properties may effectively be used in queries, just like one would query custom properties.

== Identifier and structure

|_id
|String

|_path
|String
|path, string
|Dynamic property resolved from parent path + node name

|_childOrder

== Index related

|_nodeType
|string
|string
|Used to create collections of nodes in a repository

|_indexConfig
|string
|Not indexed

== Dynamic properties

To simplify queries, the following properties are dynamically created based on the existence of other properties in a node.
They are useful for performing various types of queries.

[cols="1,1,1,2"]

|System Property |Value Type |Indexing |Comment

|_allText
|String
|string, analyzed, ngram
|Aggregates text across other string properties in the node

|_references
|Reference
|string
|Aggregates all reference properties in the node

|===


== Access control properties

Permissions set on a node are indexed differently from what the domain object looks like.
The index structure is is flattened, and enables an effective way to query nodes based on access control.
