= Nodes
:toc: right

Each entry in a repository is called a Node.

A node essentially consist of:
* one or more <<Properties>>
* An optional <<Index Configuration>>
* Optional <<Access Control>> definition

When nodes are created in a repository, the following happens:

* A unique identifier is created for the node (unless defined through import)
* A unique version identifier for the node is created
* The data is stored in a <<Blobstore>> of type node
* The node and it's specific version is then added to a <<Branch>>.  This entry keeps track of the tree-structure and other metadata for the specific node-version.
