Enonic XP extensively uses server-side JavaScript for application development.
Our goal is to enable developer of any language - PHP, .net, Java, Python, etc to quickly grasp and be productive with Enonic XP.

Here are some highlights:

* *Runs on the JVM* using the Nashorn engine. Future releases of XP are expected to be using Graal.
* *Javascripts are compiled and cached* on first request, for optimal performance
* *Multithreaded* request-response approach - simplifying software development and utilization of modern multi-core hardware
* *Based on the http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1[CommonJS module specification]* like RequireJS
