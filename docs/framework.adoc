= Javascript Framework
:toc: right
:imagesdir: framework/images

Enonic XP extensively uses server-side JavaScript for application development.
Our goal is to enable developer of any language - PHP, .net, Java, Python, etc to quickly grasp and be productive with Enonic XP.

Here are some highlights:

* *Javascripts are compiled and cached* on first request, for optimal performance
* *Multithreaded* request-response approach - simplifying software development and utilization of modern multi-core infrastructure
* *Based on the http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1[CommonJS module specification]*
* *Powered by the JVM* using the Nashorn scripting engine. Future releases of XP are expected to be using Graal.
