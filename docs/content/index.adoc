Enonic XP ships with an embedded API for Content services. The API builds on top of the repository, app engine and idproviders.
It is designed to work for both headless deployments and web content management, or both at the same time.

When combined with Content Studio, you get a powerful, but easy to use CMS.

Below is an overview of the content services:

* <<content/index#,TODO>> todo

== Shortcuts

* <<schemas/index#, Schemas>>


Author cheatsheet:
<<path/index#, Link to other page>> +
<<path/index#test, Link to other page + explicit anchor>> +
<<path/index#_section, Link to other page + section-based ancho>> +
[[explicit,An explicit Anchor]]
