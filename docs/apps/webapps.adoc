== Webapp controller
Application can implement a controller to handle HTTP requests. This is done by adding the file ``/src/main/resources/webapp/webapp.js`` to your project.

When deployed, the controller will instantly be accepting requests on ``<server>:<port>/webapp/[app-id]`` (e.g. *"/webapp/com.enonic.app.superhero"*).

``webapp.js`` file acts as an <<javascript/index#,Http controller>> and may expose a function for each HTTP method that should be handled: i.e.
GET, POST, etc.

The function that handles the request receives the request object as a parameter and returns the response object .

Below is an example webapp controller.
