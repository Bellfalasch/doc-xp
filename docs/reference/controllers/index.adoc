This section describes the core Javascript controllers of Enonic XP, and how to use them.

== Main controller
Main controllers must be located in your project as ``/src/main/resources/main.js``.
An application may only have a single main controller.

The purpose of the main controller is reacting to lifecycle events.

The main controller will be executed when an application is started.
It is possible to define event listeners that can react to application stopping events as well.
