== Introduction

Ask people what XP is, and they might say its a:

* Runtime and framework for my applications or websites
* Database/search engine that let's me run custom applications inside it
* CMS

All of the above are true. Here is our version:

Inspired by the principles of traditional Operating Systems, we asked ourself:

  "Can we provide the essential tools to build and maintain highly scalable web applications and sites - with a single dependency, and without lock-in to a proprietary cloud?"

Containers and orchestrations systems like Kubernetes help us manage networking and runtime dependencies,
but does not provide essential application services like databases, search engines and authentication.
Maintenance complexity is also on the rise, with micro services and apps written in different languages, and using different tools.

Enonic XP offers an holistic approach to the problems by providing the essential services and tools required:

* A distributed high performance <<storage/index#,NoSQL Storage and search engine>>
* A flexible application <<runtime/index#, Runtime for server Javascript and/or Java development>>
* A standardized handling of authentication through <<idproviders/index#,Identity Providers>>
* An extensible <<admin/index#, Admin Console>> for back-office tasks
* Integrated statistics and monitoring capabilities
* <<cms/index#,Content Management System>> built on and into the platform
* Development kit that lets you run the entire platform locally
* A https://market.enonic.com[Market place] for apps and developer components.
